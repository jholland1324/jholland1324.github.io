I have been inspired by my grandpa Charlie’s Autobiography and also Kelsey’s keeping of a journal to start keeping a running narrative of some kind. My grandpa wrote his autobiography in 2000 as an explanation of his life or “so that you may know who your dad is and why I am the way that I am.” He regrets that he “may not have shown or expressed [his] love… as [he] should have.” To rectify this he lays out his life on 40 typed pages that recount war, married life, his professional life and money struggles and health issues. He did well for himself, studied accounting when he got back from the war, took night classes to get ahead, built his own home in Page, Arizona and even became Vice Mayor of the small city. He did what he needed to do to provide for his family and if he didn’t show his love to them in words or hugs he did so by living an exemplary life and providing them with opportunities to do this for themselves. On the last page he lists four regrets, number three he says is “Not realizing that Charles Jr. was very sensitive and needed more attention from me.” He doesn’t explain this any further and the only other time he mentions Charles Jr. is to note that he was born. I never met him. He was my mom’s brother and he died of a heart attack when I was young. I only know they called him Fireball because of his red hair. I worry about his heart and why he died so young.</span>

It's 6:51am on a Sunday morning. A little bit later than when I would be getting up on a weekday. I can't sleep in anymore, I need to distract myself with something to keep from worrying about work. I wish that I could still be sleeping! I can't remember dreaming about anything. We are supposed to go to my parent's house today for dinner with my aunt Marie and her husband Mike. My aunt Shiela and my grandma are coming too. We used to have dinner every Sunday at my grandma's house when I was young. We would stay until after the Simpsons was over, back when a new one would be coming out on Sunday evening. I guess the new ones still do come out on Sunday evening but who knows who watches those anymore. Someone must because somehow the show keeps coming out. I think it's the longest running Sitcom in existence. I remember when I was young I thought that if they ever stopped making the Simpsons I would die. I guess things really aren't supposed to last forever, no matter how hard an end can be. We used to play the Simpsons arcade game at the Boardwalk and Chuck E. Cheese. The sidescrolling one where you would beat up people and clowns and rabbit people  for some reason as a family. I remember playing it with my mom dad and Amanda at the boardwalk. My mom liked the mini-game where you inflated the hot air balloon by mashing buttongs back and forth. She liked playing games like that. She caught all of the Pokemon in the original game and she had over 1,000,000 Neopoints. It was fun for her and probably a way to distract herself from overthinking, the way I am doing now.</span>

I was at a presentation downtown today. I parked far away accidentally, the hotel it was in wasn't where I thought it was. I paid for two hours with my credit card, thinking the meeting would be over well before 11:30. At 11:15 the meeting was still going so I left and ran. I came across an elderly couple on the sidewalk. The woman had fallen down and was on her knee, her husband couldn't get her up. "What's going on? Are you OK?" I asked them. "I fell," she said. I asked her if she wanted help or if I should call an ambulance. I didn't know if she was having a medical problem. I took her hand and together me and her husband lifted her up. She seemed to be OK and I kept running. I got a Bird and scooted until I saw a police car and got off because I didn't have a helmet. I wish I had stayed with the old couple and tried to help them more. Spencer asked when I told him about it if I found them a place to sit down. I didn't. I didn't know what I should do and I was thinking about my car and getting back to the meeting. The way she said, "I fell," is really getting to me. I wish I could give them everything that they need. I feel so bad for them I can't stop crying tonight. I wish I could trade them my life.</span>

On Saturday Kelsey and I woke up very early and drove to Borrego Springs to see a new library they built out there. When we got there it was around 5:30 and the sun was just starting to rise. It was already 90 degrees. We drove at the Palm Canyon campground. I fed a machine 10 dollar bills and slapped the ticket it printed out on my dashboard and we parked. We were worried about missing the sunrise so I asked if we could run. We scrambled up to Panarama Outlook, Kelsey's book said it was a half hour hike but I felt like it took us 10 minutes. We had mimosas at the top even though it was barely 6 in the morning and we watched the sunrise. It was purple and orange and we felt the heat intensifying with the colors. Little gnats buzzed in our ears so I took my shirt off and put it on my head. We ate cubes of cheese we had cut up the night before. We came down from the outlook and realized we still had a lot of time to kill until the library opened at 9:30 so we did the Palm Canyon hike. It was hot but a lot of it is in the canyon in the shade. We hiked out to the palm tree oasis and ate more of our snacks. When we were heading back we ran into two big horn sheep. They were drinking at the watering hole at the trailhead. One walked into some brushes and scratched itself. They didn't seem very afraid of us. Kelsey said it was a dream come true and that she could die happy. They started walking towards us and we got scared so we backed away, then they went off the trail. After that we went to the visitor center and Kelsey bought a sticker. Then we went to the library. It was cool. My company had put in a bid to design it, but they didn't win. The winner, RNT Architects, did a good job. It's elevated off the ground to combat against flash floods. The facade is pre-rusted and fits well with the surroundings. It has those cool green desert trees out front. We drove back through Julian and stopped at Nickel Brewing. The bartender was late opening, said he got drunk and woke up without his car.</span>
