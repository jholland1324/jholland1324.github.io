I have been inspired by my grandpa Charlie’s Autobiography and also Kelsey’s keeping of a journal to start keeping a running narrative of some kind. My grandpa wrote his autobiography in 2000 as an explanation of his life or “so that you may know who your dad is and why I am the way that I am.” He regrets that he “may not have shown or expressed [his] love… as [he] should have.” To rectify this he lays out his life on 40 typed pages that recount war, married life, his professional life and money struggles and health issues. He did well for himself, studied accounting when he got back from the war, took night classes to get ahead, built his own home in Page, Arizona and even became Vice Mayor of the small city. He did what he needed to do to provide for his family and if he didn’t show his love to them in words or hugs he did so by living an exemplary life and providing them with opportunities to do this for themselves. On the last page he lists four regrets, number three he says is “Not realizing that Charles Jr. was very sensitive and needed more attention from me.” He doesn’t explain this any further and the only other time he mentions Charles Jr. is to note that he was born. I never met him. He was my mom’s brother and he died of a heart attack when I was young. I only know they called him Fireball because of his red hair. I worry about his heart and why he died so young.</p>
