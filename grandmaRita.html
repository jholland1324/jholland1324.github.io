<p>Grandma Rita's Autobiography - My Life</p>
</br></br>

<p>
My father was a bookeeper at the T Packing Co. He worked a lot of overtime. Later it was taken over by the C Packing Co. Later he left there and became office manager for Frontier Foods owned by the man next door. My mother was a stay-at-home mother, doing things mothers like to do. She baked a lof for school and church functions.</p>
<p>
	The family living room was medium size. It had a fieplace and a lof of French doors that faced the front yard. It had patch work yarn pictures on the wall, a piano and couch and overstuffed chairs and an electric sewing machine and a large radio.</p>
<p>
	Before I went to sleep I usually said the Angle of God Prayer, plus God Bless Everyone. It was taught to me by my mother. My childhoom home was located in Phoenix, AZ at 1910 W. Holly Street off of 19th Avenue bt the State Fairgrounds. It was a good place to live because there was alwatys a lot going on at the Fairgrounds. It also had good neighbors.

	My grandparents on my mother's side lived in Chicago, Illinois on North Park Avenue across the street from the Elevated Train. It was far awar from Phoenix so we went to see them only a few times and during the depression you didn't travel too much. My granparents on my Father's side were deceased by then. They used to live near St. Louis, Ill. I didnt have any brothers or sisters but a lot of cousins.

	On Valentine's Day I received a Valentine from my mother of a kitten and I loved that Valentine. I even slept with it. The neighbor kids used to deliver several Valentines from across the street and I would run across the street and deliver mine. At school we would exchange Valentines with our friends. My mother or my friend's mother would take us to school every morning and come pick me up after school. It was about three miles there. During WW2 we used to take the bus there to save on gas as it was rationed in Phoenix and all over the country. When I was a child I liked pot roast and carrots and potatoes because it tasted the best. When we had chickens we had friend chicken every Sunday. My favorite pet was Mickey my bull dog I guess because it was my first pet. The chores I started out doin was making me bed and hanging up my clothes. For this I got 10 cents. For everything my mother found laying around I got deducted 1 cent for a long time I didn't get any allowence. Later I helped with the dishes and sometimes washed the kitchen floor and dusted, getting 25 cents to 50 cents. When I got to high school I got $1.00. While in high school I worked in a potato chip factory, filling bags when they needed a substitute. We could eat all the chips we wanted. I don;t remember how much I got for this, but not much. One winter we had some snow. Maybe a half inch or so. We thought we wouldn't have any school but we did anyway. By recess it was all melted. I didn't do much cooking or baking except to bake a yellow cake with chocolate icing on weekends and some times friends would come over and we would make fudge, which didn't always turn out. A few times I made some cookies. The priest and nuns didn't do any visiting in people's homes or eat dinner with them in those days. <br><br>My favorite teacher was Sister Lucille, I guess because she had the same name as my mother. We used to take her to the store after school to buy candy for the class parties. My girlfriends and I used to play dress up wearing some of my mother's old clothes she let us have. I don't remember any favorite ones. We used to play in the upstairs of a garage in the rear of the house. Once in a while I would get in a big tree in the backyard and lay on a large branch and read my books. <br><br> In high school I was in an accordion band. We used to perform at the movie theater in between the movie, also we marched in parades. I was also in Glee Club and sang for the soldiers at Army Camps. We sand in between actos of school plays and I danced in a group in a Christmas program. <br><br> My first date was with an English Cadet that my parents and I met at Church and they invited him home for the evening. The next day I went to the moview with him. He wanted to go out again but I declined. My girlfriends Bevery and Yorbic went to some of the dances that were held for the English cadets. <br><br>My first kiss was at a party at my girlfriend Norma's house when we played spin the bottle. I had to kiss the boy it pointed to. Not too good. My mother had a birthday party every year for my birthday until I was 16. It was always during the Christmas Holidays. We had ixecream and cake and played games and I opened my presents then we got our picture taken. My dad made a pretty good living during the depression and my mom was a good manager so we weren't real poor like a lot of people.
