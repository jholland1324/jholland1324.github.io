<p>Grandma Rita's Autobiography - My Life</p>
</br></br>

<p>
My father was a bookeeper at the T Packing Co. He worked a lot of overtime. Later it was taken over by the C Packing Co. Later he left there and became office manager for Frontier Foods owned by the man next door. My mother was a stay-at-home mother, doing things mothers like to do. She baked a lof for school and church functions.</p>
<p>
	The family living room was medium size. It had a fieplace and a lof of French doors that faced the front yard. It had patch work yarn pictures on the wall, a piano and couch and overstuffed chairs and an electric sewing machine and a large radio.</p>
<p>
	Before I went to sleep I usually said the Angle of God Prayer, plus God Bless Everyone. It was taught to me by my mother. My childhoom home was located in Phoenix, AZ at 1910 W. Holly Street off of 19th Avenue bt the State Fairgrounds. It was a good place to live because there was alwatys a lot going on at the Fairgrounds. It also had good neighbors.
